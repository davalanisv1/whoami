                        <h1>Beyond the<br />
                        Workshop</h1>
                        <p>I love building things, but I'm more than just an engineering student.<br /> 
                        Here is a bit about who I am when I'm not behind a screen or a robot.</p>
                    </header>
                    
                    <h2>Engineering & Adaptation</h2>
                    <p>I genuinely love engineering. Whether it's the <strong>Robostangs</strong> workshop or coding, the process of taking an idea and actually making it work is what I enjoy most. Moving between <strong>Mexico and U.S.</strong> was a big shift, but it taught me how to be comfortable in new situations. I think being able to figure things out on the fly is just as important in real life as it is in the workshop.</p>

                    <h2>What I do to reset</h2>
                    <p>While I spent my early high school years playing violin in the <strong>Symphony Orchestra</strong>, I've decided to move on from music to focus more on my engineering goals. These days, my "downtime" looks a lot more normal:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Dog:</strong> If I'm outside, I'm probably hanging out with my dog.</li>
                        <li><strong>Screen Time:</strong> I'm a big fan of movies and spend a decent amount of time on YouTube, usually keeping up with new tech or just relaxing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Friends:</strong> I value my time with my friends—whether we’re out doing something or just hanging out, that's where I recharge.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>"I believe the best engineers are the ones who know how to step away from the project, relax, and come back with a fresh perspective."</blockquote>

                    <h2>Balance</h2>
                    <p>I’m bilingual, I’m a problem-solver, and I’m a hard worker. But I’m also just someone who enjoys a good movie and a weekend off. I think that balance makes me a better teammate and a more well-rounded person.</p>
